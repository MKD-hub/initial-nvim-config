# What this is
A starting point for working with neovim, it contains all the essential starter plugins + Neotree.

### The included plugins are, in no particular order
1. Lazy
2. Treesitter
3. lualine
4. catppuccin (for the colorscheme)
5. telescope


This neovim starter code was made thanks to this [amazing YouTube guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9yqSdvAKXY&list=PLsz00TDipIffxsNXSkskknolKShdbcALR&pp=iAQB).
